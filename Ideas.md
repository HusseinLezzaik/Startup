74. Solve the problem of thinking everyday what to buy from stores, and what food to eat. Have a subscription based model where using an app or website, you plan your meal for a month in advance and pay a fee. Everything will be delivered for you weekly maybe. You then don't need to worry about eating the right nutrition for you, driving to buy food, etc. Save time for people to focus on doing their things. 
75. We should get away from the notion of one prescription for all seven billion people on the planet based mostly on their weight. There is much to be done around personalization and targeted medicine. Eliminate symptons based medicine and treatments.

85. Make living in cities where there's lots of economic opportunities cheaper, by cheaper housing. There's already a high demand market for that
86. Customer Feedback: always lots of important features that I wish companies implemented, some even do them after time like Whatsapp voice speed, or microsoft markdown text. Make it easier for users to request features and companies scale on them

102. Fix luggage lost with airlines
103. University alternative [sama tweet about US colleges broken](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1505597910053916672) maybe a set of industry interships, along research labs, plus some online courses to prepare for interviews
104. Re-writing the economy, rules, laws, make them more complex and better using AI
105. Defence company to leverage software
106. Creating synthetic humans, solving marriage issues
107. Space industry and travel
108. Increasing GDP and wealth distribution
109. Video games like Angry Birds
110. Education Technology, replace universities for good.
111. AI for services instead of software. Its a bigger pie to replace part of a law firm service with AI than to create a software tool to sell for Law firms.
112. Imagine new hardware and phones built for AI. Like a new phone where you don't need to type anymore, just scroll like tiktok, you can talk with AI, it can take notes for you, read things for you, add things to your to do list, order stuff, appointments, etc
113. 6 months funding for people who want to explore new options in there careers, to learn a new skill set or to find another job.

121. Software tool to track exponential curves and growth, trends with a nice UI
122. Fashion industry: people are willing to pay 1000s of dollars for small items that give them a sense of privilige or makes them feel rich. How can we enter the market with some brand and make something new for the rich.
123. Create services for the rich people and their inner circle. Make their life easier; lots of big margin even though the market isn't extremely big.
124. Build platforms to connect the popular famous singers with their fans; like 1 on 1s etc

130. Create a better way for users to send feedback, feature requests to companise to improve and communicate what they want
131. Create digital after life for humans
132. Nanotech and fusion with humans. What the profiles of the future gets wrong is getting over-hyped by the current technologies and missing out on what can have potentially a huge impact.
133. Biotech
134. Match current events algorithm with previous historical ones.
135. Invsibile hardware: as compute became more powerful, computer began to shrink, and it's by design we use phones. Instead, imagine having something like RewindAI that collects everything from you, and no need for hardware.
136. Industry research labs like OpenAI, Bell Labs, Xeroc Parc, etc for the new new thing gives lots of competitive advantages
137. Telepathy
138. Clinical trials

142. Create something close to the peter thiel fellowship, or sam altman idea where you assemble a 100 super talented people with 250k a year for 10 years; let them avoid pressure to earn and let them create novel things. it should pay off; give them mentors and right set of community. Financial model be like: if you want to become a writer/politician/etc you can freely do that; but if you create a startup we get to invest on pre-defined terms. Close a little to university, but unis are not good at supporting spin-outs.
143. Funding talented people for a year or giving off grants to new grad or grad students to work on technical projects is a great way to add more talent into the field, close to the openai model of training researchers
144. Funding model invention, maybe using AI as well
145. Use AI to allocate capital efficiently, like if we know how to predict cancer research, or what startups to invest in
146. Electric Airplanes or Hydrogen based planes
147. Fission or fusion as a propellant for rockets
148. Underground delivery of goods and services from shops/restaurants/stores directly into homes

152. Business model to scale restaurants into something like mcdonalds, like pizza place everyone should be able to scale
153. KPIs for restaurants platform to help them grow and scale and bring technology into it.
154. Own businesses that trade with high margins, things like water/food/clothes have high margins of profit
155. Countries are heavily reliable on each other economy wise, maybe one can build an engine to accelerate growth in that direction and make more money
156. Replicate success of McDonalds and Starbucks for food + realstate with something like Abdallah Chicken or Coco or Pizzeria
157. Look for new categories that will be created because of AI. All services will be elevated because of AI. People's throughput will increase.
158. Bounty programs to find bugs, solve open ended problems, et 
159. Look at what used to be hard to solve is now open thanks to AI.
160. YC for restaurants. Main blocker of most young founders of restaurants is access to capital, and a network like YC. Idea is to create an investment firm for restaurants and then maybe scale into other retailers like Costco or Ikea. Also focus on making these places a world recognized brand like Starbucks, Tims, McDonalds, Abdallah, etc these kind of businesses
161. Create hyperloop trains like Boring Company, but kind of like Eurostar or essential businesses to connect cities and countries in developed countries.
162. An everything game. Fun, teaches problem solving, etc.
163. Nanotech medicine that just goes inside body and heals it like the minimum seduction
164. Extending brain memory and access to information much faster. Learn chinese over night, connect with machines. Kinda like Neuralink
165. Give computers the ability to smell like humans
166. Investment firm based off of reading data from the real world. Reading images off of satellites for example for oil companies to predict supply/demand.
167. Fashion companies spend a lot of money on influencers to promote their goods/services, maybe there's a different way to do this.
168. A project to collect customer feedback from users, in the form of voice/text and then summarize using AI so that teams can build new features. A lot of times I find very strong problems that needs to be solved, for example Google Maps on highways. Writing emails is too slow and time consuming on both parties side.
169. Take care of Nuclear wastes for some exchange of money
170. Fix remote work inefficiencies
171. To solve climate change, come up with an efficient carbon capture method and make cost of power energy cheaper. Use AGI to solve this.
172. The frontiers of AI Labs compared to academia is in engineering culture + compute/data. But lots of important simple questions that can be asked be academia and would immediately get attention like: how do we measure intelligence/performance, control these models, etc. Focus on the most important problems.
173. Now is the golden age of starting a company, probably the best time to be young and luckiest to be a founder. There's an opportunity to create value in a new way, where incumbents might mess up, and many frontiers to be explored for the first time.
174. Do Alchemy by transforming metals into gold.
175. Black mirrors game engagement level, you disconnect from reality and live inside the game. Feel things in simulation as if real.
176. Interactive textbooks, where you can chat with them
177. Digital Currency that emulates the good from bitcoin and captures the market of people using bitcoin to (1) use a currency not controlled by any government (2) anonymity and privacy (3) ease of transactions world wide.
178. Services for the wealthy only: like private planes and vacations, events, etc small market high margins
179. Mega-cities: re-imagine urban infrastructure and cities. With remote work lots of economic value is being displaced from one place to another, maybe we can build something that accelerates that or captures that growth somehow.
180. Modern Democracy: a system that with the use of AI stops wasting tax money of people. Capital allocation will become much more efficient with AI, and intelligence/energy will be cheaper. We may be able to make more money for governments while dropping down the tax rates of people. Also maybe give governments less control in a way that it's no longer an org that noone can compete with.
181. Faster than light transportation technology, or like the Boring Technology for Space is super important.
182. Uber Air: something that provides local flights that are much faster, save time from traffic, and affordable. Ideally autonomous electric planes.
183. Expanding the Economic Bounds of Humankind into space, via making drugs or whatever.
184. The Electrification of Everything from Sky to Sea.
185. Making healthcare more personalized, data-driven and using wearables.
186. Self-healing software and codebases.
187. Non-profits: like Noora Health, biggest problem is getting un-restricted donations, they're at the size of like 400 people, they provide service of saving lives while bringing the cost down. Lots of room for non-profits to operate.
188. Help people solve depression and become more happier.
189. Statistics for gamers, and tools to make their lives better.
190. Nuclear energy factories by extracting carbons
191. Dis-infection solutions like UVC, but built for a real need.
192. Medicine: The way people do medicine today is increase specialization, you go to one doctor that then takes you to a different doctor etc.
193. Doctors Tooling: lots of software takes administrative time by doctors. There is a huge shortage of medical doctors all over the world.
194. Consulting services like B2B but to adapt and use technology
195. Fix birth rates, do advanced AI matching for people to get married
196. Think about existing products, say electric cars, and how you can make them 100x cheaper.
197. Many services that the Government uses and pays for, like defense, are incentivized to charge them money and take longer. Andurel tackled this for example and was able to resolve it. Think of more such opportunities.
