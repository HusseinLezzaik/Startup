## Ideas
1. AI Assistants (Dr, Bank Expert, Math, etc)
2. Gaining experience to find an internship or job: OS job that's paid
3. Detecting what's real/fake AI and authentication of data
4. Make it easy to learn any language
5. Contracting Business (does deployments and implementations)
6. Frameworks & Tools for AI 
7. A New Robotics Operating System (Better than ROS)
8. Help less represented people gain more exposure
9. Mentors to help teach you anything
10. AI Consultant ex. as a Lawyer, Accountant
11. Chatbot engineers that help SWE operate on high creative level
12. Buy anything, anywhere
13. Make telecommunication cheap in Canada
14. Realestate: make housing affordable for all, fix system
15. Fix government resources allocation in capital 
16. Generate scientific discovery using AI
17. Smart homes: like TESS from movie Salvation, computes things for you to see on a screen like weather in some place, book hotel for me, check my innboxes and emails
18. Merging with robots
19. Talking with animals
20. Make banks transactions faster and real-time
21. Evolving codebases
22. Fix universities and research system
23. Plant computer chips in humans as a service: location, health monitoring, plant in the hand for example
24. A new programming language
25. Merge brain with compute (like Neuralink), download knowledge into brain, run compute fast
26. Make computers much faster for the things that can be automated, ie transform mechanical energy into digital energy. for example bash written to do things we describe in voice
27. Search in videos and audio
28. Make neural networks learn and inference at same time like human brains
29. Audio generation of each person voice. Setup by recording your voice for 10min. Can be used on blogs, etc.
30. Models as a Service, since models training will cost around 500$ in 2030
31. Cure cancer and other diseases using AI technology
32. Extend humans life using drugs
33. Restaurants: Make opening a restaurant easy, using robots. You give us the ingredients, food, and we design robots for you. 
34. Medicine School: fix the system, make it easier for people to study medicine without having big debt, and make it more of an engineering field
35. Globalism: make it easier to collaborate in business, ex: mrbeast needs translators in each country that are famous, replit wants famous programming youtubers to create courses, etc
36. Build systems that are collaborative instead of acting on their own to make people more productive.
37. Social networks like Facebook are one-to-one, and Tiktok concept of one-to-many with followers created influencers that people connect with without really knowing them.
38. Hollywood AI: using AI to generate anime or movies.
39. AI for Fashion
40. AI for 3D Design and Analysis like SolidWorks, Ansys
41. AI alignment: make something to control progress in AI so that the worst outcomes don't happen
42. Virtual Reality for Education: help students visualize electromagnetic waves, discover space, replace zoom for lectures, etc
43. Legacy Reservation: wouldn't you wish you could understand general relativity in Eisteins voice? Record all humans voice and literature and link them for future generations
44. Tech for Women Problems: after birth depression, work and children balance, etc

## Industry
