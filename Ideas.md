32. Extend humans life using drugs
33. Restaurants: Make opening a restaurant easy, using robots. You give us the ingredients, food, and we design robots for you. 
34. Medicine School: fix the system, make it easier for people to study medicine without having big debt, and make it more of an engineering field
35. Globalism: make it easier to collaborate in business, ex: mrbeast needs translators in each country that are famous, replit wants famous programming youtubers to create courses, etc
36. Build systems that are collaborative instead of acting on their own to make people more productive.
37. Social networks like Facebook are one-to-one, and Tiktok concept of one-to-many with followers created influencers that people connect with without really knowing them.

44. Tech for Women Problems: after birth depression, work and children balance, etc
45. Make energy generation cheaper, and reduce carbon emissions
46. Web3: block-chain technology, decentralized and secure networks
47. Compiler: write better compilers that make errors and bugs more obvious to solve, across all programming languages

72. 3D Printing, remove complexity in manufacturing process
73. Quantum Computing
74. Solve the problem of thinking everyday what to buy from stores, and what food to eat. Have a subscription based model where using an app or website, you plan your meal for a month in advance and pay a fee. Everything will be delivered for you weekly maybe. You then don't need to worry about eating the right nutrition for you, driving to buy food, etc. Save time for people to focus on doing their things. 
75. We should get away from the notion of one prescription for all seven billion people on the planet based mostly on their weight. There is much to be done around personalization and targeted medicine. Eliminate symptons based medicine and treatments.
76. Extract natural resources from the water.
77. AI 24/7 free physicians.
78. Taking care of elderly people with robotics, and help those without family to help them as well as economics.

82. Spotify for Books
83. Bridge the gap between city and villages other places in terms of wealth, health, education, etc
84. Match talent with new parents. Since talent is equally distributed globally, what stops lots of people from becoming great founders is the cultural background of their parents. [Sam Altman, -37mins](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/sam-altman/) says other thing than OpenAI he'd work on. Can work an AI to take care of people developing these skills and grow
85. Make living in cities where there's lots of economic opportunities cheaper, by cheaper housing. There's already a high demand market for that
86. Customer Feedback: always lots of important features that I wish companies implemented, some even do them after time like Whatsapp voice speed, or microsoft markdown text. Make it easier for users to request features and companies scale on them
87. Education System: sama says that his biggest blessing was loving parents, and education. Lets solve the latter that might solve the former.
88. Fix customer support at Apple, Amazon using AI like ChatGPT
89. Africa is growing fast, lots of economic opportunity

97. Research as a Service
98. Diffusion models for generating training sets as a service using LLMs
99. Autopilot AI products + Copilot AI products
100. AI for Travel Planning; like IBS but instead of traditional OR and CS for NP hard problems, try using AI instead to build a schedule
101. I always dreamed of traveling the whole world, visiting all the main cultures in the world. Create some business model that enables that. Just like how the founder of Nike had this opportunity when he was young to do so.
102. Fix luggage lost with airlines
103. University alternative [sama tweet about US colleges broken](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1505597910053916672) maybe a set of industry interships, along research labs, plus some online courses to prepare for interviews
104. Re-writing the economy, rules, laws, make them more complex and better using AI
105. Defence company to leverage software
106. Creating synthetic humans, solving marriage issues
107. Space industry and travel
108. Increasing GDP and wealth distribution
109. Video games like Angry Birds
110. Education Technology, replace universities for good.
111. AI for services instead of software. Its a bigger pie to replace part of a law firm service with AI than to create a software tool to sell for Law firms.
112. Imagine new hardware and phones built for AI. Like a new phone where you don't need to type anymore, just scroll like tiktok, you can talk with AI, it can take notes for you, read things for you, add things to your to do list, order stuff, appointments, etc
113. 6 months funding for people who want to explore new options in there careers, to learn a new skill set or to find another job.
114. Consumer space flight 
115. Faster flight: ~3 hours to Tokyo from SF
116. DNA-editing / enhancing our bodies (e.g. CISPR)
117. Robots that exceed human ability
118. Slowing aging by 2x
119. Fusion
120. Create national social network; where lebanese have to prove their nationality to join the social network. And can easily explore themselves along their contact info.
121. Software tool to track exponential curves and growth, trends with a nice UI
122. Fashion industry: people are willing to pay 1000s of dollars for small items that give them a sense of privilige or makes them feel rich. How can we enter the market with some brand and make something new for the rich.
123. Create services for the rich people and their inner circle. Make their life easier; lots of big margin even though the market isn't extremely big.
124. Build platforms to connect the popular famous singers with their fans; like 1 on 1s etc
125. Scale somethinh like Tim Hortons globally
126. Something like Abdallah but for the whole world
127. Face matching software for survailance, given an image of someone find all other similar people
128. Technology for defense and police to increase safety using AI.
129. People will be living more online since brain is connected to the cloud, therefore we can help them find other mates
130. Create a better way for users to send feedback, feature requests to companise to improve and communicate what they want
131. Create digital after life for humans
132. Nanotech and fusion with humans. What the profiles of the future gets wrong is getting over-hyped by the current technologies and missing out on what can have potentially a huge impact.
133. Biotech
134. Match current events algorithm with previous historical ones.
135. Invsibile hardware: as compute became more powerful, computer began to shrink, and it's by design we use phones. Instead, imagine having something like RewindAI that collects everything from you, and no need for hardware.
136. Industry research labs like OpenAI, Bell Labs, Xeroc Parc, etc for the new new thing gives lots of competitive advantages
