# Working at Playground AI

At [Playground AI](https://playgroundai.com/), we‚Äôre building an image editor that combines AI research and product design to enable people to create graphics like a Pro without being one.

Over the next 5 years we plan to make progress in creating intelligence that exceeds current human capability in manipulating pixels. It should accomplish challenging tasks ranging from instructing an AI to make subtle changes to images, creating entire 3D environments, and understanding context of a scene in a video. We plan to start by accomplishing difficult tasks with images first.

Our mission is to push the boundaries of what computers can do with graphics to awaken the imagination within each of us.

**If you join us, you‚Äôll be an early team member in helping shape:**

1. Our future company culture
2. Our engineering practices
3. People that we hire
4. The direction & focus of our products

`**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**`

**How do I get in touch?**

You can email us: [jobs@playgroundai.com](mailto:jobs@playgroundai.com) & we‚Äôll be in touch! If your resume and background appear like a good match, someone will reach out for an initial phone screen.

**Who else works at Playground?**

A few friends contract with us as well across design & engineering who work part-time.

**Where is Playground located?**

We do not have an official office. We all work 100% remotely from home: San Francisco, Santa Barbara, Toronto, NYC, Berlin, etc.

If working out of a physical location with most of your co-workers is your preference a majority of the time, we would not recommend applying.

Separating physical location from economic opportunity let‚Äôs us radically expand the number of great people we can work with in the world.

**Are you okay with remote employment?**

Yes but only in the U.S. and Canada at this time due to timezone convenience and administration. We have been building a remote culture from day 1 prior to COVID-19. Exceptions apply for exceptional people.

As we grow, we plan to expand to more regions steadily once we have people in adjacent timezones.

**Have you raised any money?**

Yes - happy to tell you how much over the phone. We are a post-Series A company.

It‚Äôs in the many millions of dollars range, from firms and people like [Initialized](https://initialized.com/), [Max Levchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Levchin), [Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)), [Aaron Levie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Levie), [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), [Paul Buchheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Buchheit), [Ron Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Conway), [Kyle Vogt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Vogt), [Balaji](https://balajis.com/about/), etc.

**Do you provide any healthcare benefits?**

Yes - medical, dental, vision, FSA and 401K (no match).

We also provide paid leave for loss of pregnancy for women of 2 weeks as well as cover travel and medical expenses for employees to obtain critical reproductive services.

**How will Playground make money?**

We‚Äôll charge our users a subscription to use our creative tools. You can see our [pricing plans here](https://playgroundai.com/pricing).

Our customers are pro-users and creators: people who might create books, have a YouTube channel, an Etsy store, etc. They aren‚Äôt your typical Adobe Photoshop user since our products make creative tools more accessible to more people.

**How many people do you plan to hire?**

We plan to grow the team a bit to around ~15 total people through 2023. The next set of people are going to help us to do cutting edge research and ship excellent products that improve the creative possibilities for our customers.

**What‚Äôs the interview process like?**

We‚Äôll likely do a quick 45-minute call just to make sure we‚Äôre on the same page. After that, we‚Äôd work together on a process that feels fair.

Generally, there are two options:

1. Our preferred situation is that we get to work together for several weeks on a full-time project (of course, we‚Äôd pay you whatever you think is fair). Often working together for a bit is a great way to determine whether there‚Äôs a good match as future teammates and it can give you a lot of transparency. We understand, however, that‚Äôs not always possible for everyone. Our minimum expectation for this trial is for 4 weeks, 40 hours per week.
    1. There is still an interview process (via Zoom) with this option, but shorter.
2. A formal but practical interview--no trick/puzzle questions. (3-4 hours)
3. Maybe there‚Äôs a third option we haven‚Äôt thought of--we‚Äôre open-minded :)

For design roles, there will typically be a 1-hour portfolio review to understand process, thinking, and skill.

**Who are your competitors?**

In the short-term, there are many image generation creation tools that could be construed as competitors but we suspect our long-term plans will cause our paths to diverge eventually. Perhaps the most obvious competitor might be past-generation creative tools like Adobe‚Äôs Creative Suite but since the customers are likely different we don‚Äôt see this as a worrisome issue just yet.

**What does your tech stack look like?**

The user-facing product primarily is built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Python, Tailwind, Postgres, Redis. For inference, we‚Äôre using PyTorch on many clusters of 8xA100 GPUs. Currently we rent GPUs but we‚Äôll be soon using our purchased hardware early this year.

We‚Äôre still early on in thinking about AI-training stack but we‚Äôre primarily working in PyTorch.

**What is work/life balance like at your company?**

We usually leave work around 6 PM to have dinner with friends or family. As a result of being an early stage startup, we wouldn‚Äôt want to hide this reality to prospective candidates: raw hours actually make a big difference in the impact we can make right now. This won‚Äôt always be the case but it is at present. So, often we find ourselves working later on in the evening, on rare occasions a weekend, but it‚Äôs mostly driven by personal ambition. We don‚Äôt have any expectations of anyone to do so.

**Our cultural values are...**

_An abridged version_

- Making users happy: our decisions, intention, results, and motivation stem from trying to please our users.
- Asynchronous communication: deep work requires large chunks of time so we try to communicate asynchronously to provide more time for deep work.
- Results driven: We do what we promised each other, customers, users, and investors. While effort is recognized, it‚Äôs not regarded equally. We care about what you achieve.
- Kindness: While being kind may not seem ruthlessly connected to outcomes, it does make work a lot more fun. We suspect that‚Äôs key to doing great work over a long period of time.
- Speed: We believe speed is a competitive advantage as a company. As companies get larger, they tend to get slower‚Äîwe hope to decelerate that as much as possible. You should feel comfortable asking: ‚ÄúCould we do this faster?‚Äù

We want to be upfront about this: we do not institute quotas to be diverse ‚Äî we have a goal to be the most talented company in the industry and we end up being diverse as a result of that goal. Playground AI plans to be a globally distributed company and we recognize that when it comes to politics, we value different viewpoints, but we don‚Äôt want to allow those differences to negatively affect our relationships with each other.

**Are you open to bringing on interns for any of your roles?**

Not at this time‚Äîunfortunately, we don‚Äôt have the bandwidth necessary to offer a stellar internship program. We need to invest every ounce of energy into making a great product first. We may reconsider in early 2024.

**Have you seen anybody with a stutter or other speech impediment and how have you handled that?**

We tend to err on asynchronous written communication, videos, audio notes, commenting in our task management app, etc. so an emphasis on speaking ability is less important at Playground AI. We do require you to speak good English however.

As long as you can communicate densely/succinctly, we encourage you to apply.

_We hire candidates of any race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, marital or family status, disability, Veteran status, and any other status._

Unfortunately, there‚Äôs not much we can do but we don‚Äôt want to leave you with the impression that we‚Äôre lazy. We are the original authors and can prove it if you have doubt.
